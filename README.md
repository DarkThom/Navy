# Navy
===================

- Player 1 : USAGE ./navy navy_positions
-----------------------------------------------------------
- Player 2 : USAGE ./navy [first_player_pid] navy_positions
-----------------------------------------------------------

You all know the very famous Battleship game. 
The two players are ONLY allowed to comunicate using the signals SIGUSER1 and SIGUSER2 . 
The map size is 8x8. On each turn, you must display your positions, and then your enemyâ€™s positions. 
At the end of the game (when all the ships of a player have been hit), you must display whether "I won" (and return 0) or "Enemy won" (and return 1).

Example of Map File
-------------------
**2:C1:C2 
  3:D4:F4 
  4:B5:B8 
  5:D7:H7**  

The file passed as parameter must contain lines formatted the following way : 
LENGTH : FIRST_SQUARE : LAST_SQUARE  
Where LENGTH is the length of the ship, 
FIRST_SQUARE and LAST_SQUARE its first and last positions.  
In this file, you must have 4 ships (of lengths 2,3,4 and 5). 
If the navy file is invalid, you have to quit the program and consider it as an error.
